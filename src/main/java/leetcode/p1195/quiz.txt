Implement a multithreaded version of FizzBuzz with four threads.
The same instance of FizzBuzz will be passed to four different threads:

1. Thread A will call fizz() to check for divisibility of 3 and outputs fizz.
2. Thread B will call buzz() to check for divisibility of 5 and outputs buzz.
3. Thread C will call fizzbuzz() to check for divisibility of 3 and 5 and outputs fizzbuzz.
4. Thread D will call number() which should only output the numbers.
